"""The badminton animations, written against the Meshy rig.

A pose is a dictionary of bone name to three rotations in degrees, and the rotations
are about the *world* axes rather than the bone's own. That is deliberate. Meshy's
characters arrive through glTF, which has no concept of a bone tail, so Blender guesses
one — and every bone in this rig came in over a thousand units long pointing somewhere
arbitrary. Bone-local euler angles on a rig like that are unguessable. World axes are
not, because the character stands in a known orientation:

    +Z is up          -Y is the way they are facing        +X is their left

The character is generated in a T-pose, so every arm angle here is a departure from
straight out sideways, not from hanging at the side. That catches you out: an arm at
rest by the hip is a large rotation, not a small one. The two arms are mirror images,
so their signs are opposite:

    RightArm      +Y raises overhead,  -Y drops to the hip
                  +Z swings forward,   -Z swings back behind
    LeftArm       -Y raises overhead,  +Y drops to the hip
                  -Z swings forward,   +Z swings back behind
    RightForeArm  +Z bends the elbow,  LeftForeArm  -Z bends the elbow

Elbows bend about the arm's own rest frame, which is carried along by the shoulder, so
"bend the elbow" means the same thing whether the arm is overhead or by the hip.

Below the waist both sides share signs, because a hip and a knee only fold one way:

    UpLeg    -X swings the leg forward, +X back
    Leg      +X bends the knee
    Spine    +X leans the body forward

Frames are at 24 fps. `loop` marks the clips that repeat rather than play once; the
game reads that list too, so a clip only has to be described in one place.

    """Leans the whole body forward from the ankles, keeping the feet on the floor.

    The obvious way to lean somebody forward is to bend their spine, and on this rig it
    barely works. Meshy's auto-rigging puts the torso almost entirely on the hip bone
    and the neck — the three spine bones between them carry 418 units of weight against
    the hips' 601 — so a forty-degree bend at the waist moves a sliver of shirt and
    leaves the player standing upright.

    Rotating the hips does move the whole body, but it takes the legs with it and lifts
    the feet off the floor. So the hips turn and both thighs turn back by the same
    amount, which cancels at the knee and leaves a body leaning over planted feet.
